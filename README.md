# scvr
Virtual reality Soundcloud player. It was first meant to be used with the Google Cardboard as a standalone app, but will now persue in the state of a web app.

You can try a demo at http://renaudfv.github.io/scvr/. Navigation currently works by drag and drop. Tracks are played on click events, but listeners are not great for the moment.

#TO-DO
- [ ] Clean code / design fixes
- [ ] Change event listeners so that they don't have any offset
- [ ] Enable accelerometer navigation for mobile devices
- [ ] Enable vocal search
- [ ] Port code to WebVR to use with the Occulus Rift
